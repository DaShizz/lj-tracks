Just a few tracks I've made in the past by watching VODS from NoPixel community. More will be added overtime.

# Installation
* Open your phone in-game and create a new race under which ever place holder name you'd like then save it (you need to make at least 10 checkpoints)

![Step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91661118/140831214-286dd44e-931d-4b02-9a34-4835854a1324.PNG)
* Open your SQL Database and find **"lapraces"** table

* Open **"lapraces"** table then find the placeholder name you made for the race track
* Open **"checkpoints"** section and delete the existing one
